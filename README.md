# Bruin Score Check üêªüìù

Chrome Extension that calculates an unofficial, unweighted grade on MyUCLA's gradebook. Available for [download](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/bruin-score-check/oiaaakgmkokimooplkmekiancodahaok) now!

## Purpose

MyUCLA's gradebook doesn't give you a total score, so it's often hard to tell where you stand in the class.

Bruin Score Check adds up all the scores in the "Grades" column to give you an unweighted, unofficial final grade.
